* The Problem
Many custom emacs themes provide their own color palettes as a variable or
collection of variables. Unfortunately for users who enjoy using theme-specific
colors in various parts of emacs, there is no universal way to access these
colors programmatically. Some theme collections define their own functions to
access colors via elisp, but these solutions are not homogeneous across theme
collections.

=technicolor= attempts to partially solve this problem by allowing the user to
define a "universal" palette which contains colors that all the themes they
would like to use in elisp implement. Then the user may use technicolor to
access the colors in the universal palette, which would then access the correct
theme-dependent color that the user specifies.
